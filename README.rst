PyRate is a Python tool for estimating the average rate (velocity) and incremental time-series of surface movement for every pixel in a stack of images generated by interferometric processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. It has been designed to use GAMMA or ROI_PAC format geocoded unwrapped interferograms.

PyRate started life as a partial Python translation of Pirate, a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong University of Technology.

PyRate is compatible with: Python 3.
